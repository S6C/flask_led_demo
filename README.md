This will control a sensehat from a webpage. When the checkbox is clicked the sensehat will light up. When clicked again the sensehat will turn off.

You need a Raspberry Pi with the sensehat attached (or change the code to use the software version).

Connect to the IPaddress:5000 to run the server.
